# art-fert-prediction-tool
A prediction algorithm for optimal number of oocytes to fertilize during in vitro fertilization treatment.

This repository holds the code used to develop [this interactive prediction tool](https://katharine-correia.shinyapps.io/ivf_prediction_tool/), including code to wrangle data, build models, and assess operating characteristics.

The code was developed using data provided from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) Clinical Outcome Reporting System (CORS). The data is not publicly available and cannot be shared here. Researchers associated with a SART member clinic can submit a research request through the SART CORS research portal. See [SART's Research Overview](https://www.sart.org/professionals-and-providers/research/) for more information. Clinics wishing to develop a similar algorithm based on their own clinic's data can use this example to follow a similar workflow with their data.

This work is funded by NIH Award 5R03HD102518-02.
